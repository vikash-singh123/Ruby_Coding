# Unless
# Good! Now let's review the unless statement.

# problem = false
# print "Good to go!" unless problem
# Remember, this is basically a short hand if statement. It will do whatever you ask unless the condition is true. In our example, problem is false, so we don't have a problem. We print Good to go!

# Instructions
# Create an unless statement in the editor. The statement should print something to the console.

prob = true
print "Hi, There" unless prob
